# Atlas Modding
***
We're a development team that primarily works on Minecraft mods, however, we do intend to branch out in terms of scope. As of yet, our focus is to make enjoyable experiences that restore lost mods and ideas, or otherwise bring unique and enjoyable experiences which you would not find elsewhere. A few of our planned projects are vanilla plus, however, we won't focus on such mods, as our main goals are to restore what has been lost, and defy the norms.
