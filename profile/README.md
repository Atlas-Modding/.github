# Atlas Modding
***
We're a development team that primarily works on Minecraft mods, however, we do intend to branch out in terms of scope. As of yet, our focus is to make enjoyable experiences that restore lost mods and ideas, or otherwise bring unique and enjoyable experiences which you would not find elsewhere. A few of our planned projects are vanilla plus, however, we won't focus on such mods, as our main goals are to restore what has been lost, and defy the norms.

## How to join

***

If you wish to work alongside us on future projects, you should contact me on Discord(username is alexaipaw). You aren't obligated to do anything, you work when you want and on what you want, if you wish for one of your projects to become an Atlas project, then simply ask. Provided the project meets the requirements, namely being open-source and fitting for our brand, we will add it. An Atlas project means it has its own channel on the Discord server, it is tracked on the server for updates, and other members are free to work on it whenever. When you contact me, I will evaluate your own personal eligibility. This means that you must have open source projects, be willing to work on code which is open source, and must also agree to not use our code without explicit permission.
